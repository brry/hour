Get started with R in a few hours  
Berry Boessenkool, [brry.github.io](https://brry.github.io/), June 2018 - April 2022

Before your short R intro course, please

- install R and R Studio, see [instructions](https://bookdown.org/brry/course/install.html)
- download the course [material](https://github.com/brry/hour/raw/master/Material/Rintro.zip) to a sensible location (`Downloads` is not one)
- unzip it (the zip-file contains the folder `Rintro` with 4 files)
